    ai_recommendation: Widen the stop loss to improve the win rate. (In a choppy market
      regime, the current stop loss is likely too tight, leading to frequent stop-outs
      and a low win rate. By widening the stop, the strategy may capture more winning
      trades.)

    ai_recommendation: Increase the profit target to improve the profit factor. (The
      current low win rate and profit factor indicate that while the average win matches
      the average loss, the strategy is not generating enough profitable trades to
      be effective; increasing the target can help improve the profit factor.)

    ai_recommendation: Widen the stop loss to improve the win rate. (The current win
      rate is low, indicating that the strategy may be too strict with its stop loss,
      leading to frequent losses. Widening the stop could allow more trades to remain
      open longer and potentially turn into winners.)
